## Requirements

### Build Dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake pkg-config \
    libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev \
    libminizip-dev libtinyxml2-dev
```

### Runtime Dependencies (on device)

All required shared libraries are pre-installed on Anbernic H700 devices:

- SDL2 (2.0.12+)
- SDL2_image (2.0.9+)
- SDL2_ttf
- SDL2_gfx
- mpv (for video playback)

```

## Technical Notes

### GPU Driver Compatibility

The H700 uses a Mali G31 GPU. SDL2's `SDL_RENDERER_ACCELERATED` may fail on some firmware versions. The application automatically falls back to software rendering if hardware acceleration is unavailable.

### Cross-Compilation

The device runs Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with glibc 2.35. To build binaries compatible with the device:

- Use GCC ≤ 12 to avoid GLIBCXX version mismatches
- Link against glibc ≤ 2.35
- A native aarch64 build (inside an arm64 Docker container) produces working binaries

### mpv IPC

Volume control is implemented via mpv's JSON IPC interface. The socket path is `/tmp/tv-mpv-<pid>.sock`.
